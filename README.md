kangae | a list of ideas

I'm not sure where this is headed, so be cool. Basically I wanted to publish some ideas because I'm not going to work on them.


## (sort this, enventually)

- [ ] A list or blog that curates the best free online courses on YouTube. This makes it easy to download them for offline viewing, without hunting individual videos or dealing with YouTube's messy interface.
- [ ] An online shop with just BSD/Linux laptops and Cyanogen/Replicant phones. Some exist with some of the features, but usually it's either outdated hardware or pricey. (I understand the limitations, thank you.)
- [ ] I had this idea called _Utopia Labs_, where people basically describe their dream world. The team puts those together with nice illustrations and raw designs of the thing. Could be useful as a moodboard of (utopic) stuff to work on.
- [ ] Personal finances are hard because most solutions are overkill. My bank tries to forecast the money I'll have later in the month, but it sucks very hard at this. If you know my avg. income/expenses, it can't be that hard, right? ~10% error margin is acceptable.
- [ ] Small ways to improve the world. Naomi Klein has an interesting website along these lines, but where's the non-obvious stuff you can do?
- [ ] An automatic short URL expander. If you send me a `bit.ly/asdfklj`, that's very opaque, I'm not sure I trust your link.
- [ ] An easy to understand list of popular websites being hacker. Or how easy some of it can be. I think people don't really understand how fucked they can be by a proper hacker. Even if not targetting them specifically.
- [ ] A dynamic contacts manager. Small pics of people that are relevant to my context right now. i.e. when home, make work contacts fade away/be less prominent.
- [ ] A todo list where you're forced to react. INCOMING! If you don't complete a todo, it goes away after 2 weeks. Same with emails. This basically makes you scared of not doing stuff. Right? I'm not sure it'd work.
- [ ] Micro-learning: people make small pages about stuff they've learned on a topic. Just the gist of it. People should know *at least* a bit about physics, maths, etc.
- [ ] Water with electrolyes/a bit of calcium/some ginseng/other stimulants. No sugar/crap.
- [ ] Basic internet knowledge kit. Kinda like Mozilla's web literacy program, but people are prob. better knowing about phishing than JS.
- [ ] Review books in the command line. 10 seconds to add a book I've just finished. Goodreads/etc. are super clunky.
- [ ] I've this thing I want to do where every week I send out a poll on random topics. Results are published online and lightly debated. Just to get a better sense of some stuff/general topics where I don't know if my opinion is too conformist or weird.
- [ ] Effective altruism for F/OSS and online rights/advocacy non-profits
- [ ] App: I list the food I want, and it connects me with farmers that will grow it for me. Farmers sell packages of 1sqm and I can plant there whatever I want, they take care of it, and then send it to me. We share the risk, etc.
- [ ] Code review tool: over time, developers can go through the code and mark things up for review. Instead of just when someone's pushing out something. Example: I open a file, see something funky, mark it for review (but since that's not what I'm working on, I move on, someone will review it later).
- [ ] Basic tools/gear for the home. I'm tired of the crap appliances/tools that don't can't get their core task handled right, and yet pile it up with useless extras. Smart TVs come to mind. Examples: alarm clocks that sync and have temperature and multiple tones, but no per-day alarm, volume control, soft night light. Energy-saving plugs can consume more energy than they save (saw a study about this somewhere). Fans are noisy plastic blobs with an outdated design.
- [ ] Monitor air quality indoors, but mostly pollutants and oxygen levels. Also, is humidity right for humans/etc.


## random thoughts

- _Bandcamp_ is fantastic. Why aren't more artists there, esp. the popular ones?
- Why are our languages so inneficient? See, 2 `n` characters where 1 was enough (enof).
- Decentralized storage that conforms to an API. Like I want to use Foursquare, but own my data/review/check-ins. Everyone could self-hoston their devices, and it's then P2P to build the total website. Blockchain?
