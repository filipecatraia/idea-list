# Search engine for developers

The point is: let people find things only related to code,
and perform the basic, critical actions with ease.

Example: `npm:search grunt && download:as:zip`

With the browser extension, on a website such GitHub, typing `$` activates the overlay contextual console:

```
$ git clone
$ git download:zip
$ git issue
```

On stackoverflow:

```
$ stack add:question
$ stack add:comment
```

Anywhere else:

```
$ send:to:evernote
$ email:page
$ email:section -with:id #cenas
$ twitter:page
```

But also:

- search most popular developer websites
- prepending __code:__ makes it search only for code
- crawl only pages that matter

(Command-line tool, and online presence. Searches SO, documentation, etc. You can configure it to only search for the technologies you use.)
